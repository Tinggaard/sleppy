## About
This webpage is ineteted as an app to help young people go to be earlier. It's not functional in the way that you can create users or anything, it's only meant as a draft.
The page itself is made with help from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap's homepage.") and some searching online.
